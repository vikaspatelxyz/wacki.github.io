I created this blog to document my progress in learning game development related topics. I don’t expect this to be the only thing I will post about but it will definitely be the initial focus. Of course it is mainly intended for personal use, but who knows what might happen down the line.

Well then, here is what I want to do over the next few weeks: Simply put, get a good grasp of the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). I already have some experience in Unity  so it is not a complete cold start. And luckily for me a large amount of learning material has already been built up since the UE4 release.

3D modeling, animation, texturing, level design and similar topics are also on my list of things to learn. I might not turn out to be good at any of them but the point is to have a good understanding of everything involved in making a game. Although I’d like to spend a little more time on the modeling part for sure. Also I don’t start from scratch here either as I do know the basics of blender and photoshop.

I think this post should suffice as an introduction for now, anything else will be covered while I go along.
