<p>
Tried myself at digital drawing again. It's unfinished but given the time constraints I had to work with I am quite happy how far I got. This is about 2h worth of work.

I was debating wheather or not I should post this but I think I should just go ahead and post more stuff in the first place, so from now on that is what I'm going to be doing.
